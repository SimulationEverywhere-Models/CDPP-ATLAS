How to run the zip
-------------------

1) unzip the zip file to the directory which including the CD++ tool(include simub.exe)
2) move all the plan files and tsc.bat to the directory which including the TSC compiler (include tsc.exe)
3) click the tsc.bat to generate the .ma file and .macros file
4) move back the .ma file and .macros file to the directory including the CD++ tool
5) click the simub.bat to generate the .out file 
6) click the demo.bat to generate the .drw file
7) click the draw1.bat to visualize the result of cell crossing
8) click the draw2.bat to visualize the result of cell segment

Brief description of the contents of this ZIP:
-----------------------------------------------
demo.bat: the batch file used to obtain the output .drw file

draw1.bat: the batch file used to visualize the output according to model4c1.drw file

draw2.bat: the batch file used to visualize the output according to 
model4t2.drw file

simub.bat: the batch file used to simulate the model_new.ma file and generate the model_new.out file (here I only simulate the basic model because it takes a long simulation time. If other models are to be simulated, please modify the simub.bat accordingly)

tsc.bat: the batch file used to generate the *.ma file and *.macros file according to the corresponding plan file

colour_map3.jpg: the map of the Carleton University Campus

model_new.plan: the plan file of basic campus model in TSC definition

model_newRL.plan: the plan file including a railway in the campus

model_newJB.plan: the plan file including a jobsite in the campus

model_newST.plan: the plan file including stop sign in the campus

model_newTL.plan: the plan file including traffic lights in the campus

model_newTL_ST.plan: the plan file including both traffic lights and stop sign in the campus

model4.plan: the plan file including a simple example (having two segments and one crossing). Building this example is to draw the output of each Cell-DEVS submodel.

*.ma: corresponding MA file is generated by the TSC compiler 

*.macros: corresponding MACROS file is also generated by the TSC compiler 

*.out: corresponding out file is generated by the CD++ using the *.ma file

model.col: contain the colors to draw the output for each cell 

model.pal: the pal file for the online graphical output

model4c1.drw: the drw file used for drawing the output of crossing C1

model4t1.drw: the drw file used for drawing the output of segment t1

model4t2.drw: the drw file used for drawing the output of segment t2

report3.doc: the electronic version of the final report

readme.txt: (this file)
